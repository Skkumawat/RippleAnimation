                        A Rippl is a simple UIView sublcass which draws an ellipse
                        (most probably a circle) within its frame and has 2 built-in
                        animations. You can call an "impact ripple" to create an
                        additional growing ellipse behind the original one, or you
                        can call a "gain" animation that grows the original view
                        according to the value of the gain.
